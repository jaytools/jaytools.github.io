## ⚡ 5-Step Quick Workflow

### Step 1: Create Images in Canva (15 minutes per image)
1. Go to **https://www.canva.com/**
2. Create custom size based on **DESIGN-REFERENCE.md** specs
3. Search for elements using provided keywords
4. Apply exact HEX colors from specs
5. Download as **PNG** with transparent background

**Example for Age Difference Calculator:**
- Size: 190 x 140 px
- Colors: #4A90E2 (calendars), #FF6B6B (arrow)
- Elements: Two calendar icons + arrow + "5 years" text

---

### Step 2: Convert to WebP (5 minutes per image)
1. Open **https://squoosh.app/**
2. Upload your PNG
3. Set format: **WebP**
4. Set quality: **80-85%**
5. Check file size < 20KB
6. Download

**Save as:**
- `personal/img/age-calculator.webp`
- `utility/img/dpi-checker.webp`
- etc.

---

### Step 3: Implement in HTML (5 minutes per tool)
1. Open tool HTML file (e.g., `personal/age-difference-inline.html`)
2. Go to **IMAGE-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md**
3. Copy HTML snippet for that tool
4. Paste in appropriate location (before form/calculator)
5. Copy CSS snippet
6. Paste in `<style>` section

**Key HTML pattern:**
```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="img/tool-name.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="img/tool-name.png" 
       alt="SEO-optimized description"
       width="200" 
       height="150"
       loading="eager"
       fetchpriority="high">
</picture>
```

---

### Step 4: Test Locally (2 minutes per tool)
1. Open HTML file in browser (Chrome/Edge)
2. Verify image displays correctly
3. Check responsive on mobile (DevTools → Toggle device toolbar)
4. Verify no layout shift when image loads
5. Check file loaded as WebP (DevTools → Network tab)

**Quick browser test:**
```
Desktop: Looks good? ✅
Mobile: Responsive? ✅
WebP loaded: Network tab shows .webp? ✅
```

---

### Step 5: Deploy & Measure (10 minutes total)
1. Commit to GitHub: `git add .` → `git commit -m "Add hero images to top 6 tools"` → `git push`
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub Pages deployment
3. Test live URLs
4. Run **PageSpeed Insights** for before/after comparison
5. Track scores in **TESTING-GUIDE.md** spreadsheet

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Image not showing"
- ✅ Check file path (case-sensitive on Linux servers)
- ✅ Verify file uploaded to correct folder
- ✅ Check browser console for 404 errors
- ✅ Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### "File size too large (>25KB)"
- ✅ Re-compress in Squoosh at 75-80% quality
- ✅ Remove non-essential elements from design
- ✅ Use simpler gradients/fewer colors
- ✅ Try AVIF format (even smaller)

### "Layout shifts when image loads"
- ✅ Add explicit width/height attributes
- ✅ Use aspect-ratio CSS property
- ✅ Reserve space with min-height on container
- ✅ Use loading="eager" for above-fold images

### "PageSpeed score dropped"
- ✅ Add preload tag for hero image
- ✅ Use fetchpriority="high" on critical images
- ✅ Ensure images are compressed properly
- ✅ Check if image became the LCP element (not ideal)

### "WebP not loading in old browsers"
- ✅ Keep PNG fallback in `<picture>` element
- ✅ Test in Safari 13 or older
- ✅ Check `<source>` tag comes before `<img>` tag
