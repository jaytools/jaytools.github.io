## 🎯 Image Positioning (Answer to Your Question)

### ✅ OPTIMAL LAYOUT - No Scroll Problem!

**Flow:** TITLE → IMAGE → CALCULATOR FORM

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🏠 Breadcrumb                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  📝 TOOL TITLE                      │  ← User sees first
│     (Subtitle/Description)          │
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│        🖼️ IMAGE HERE                │  ← Visual context
│      (with background)              │
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  📊 CALCULATOR FORM                 │  ← Immediate access
│     [Input fields]                  │
│     [Calculate Button]              │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

## ⚠️ About CSS Warnings

### Inline Style Warnings (Not Errors!):
```
⚠️ "CSS inline styles should not be used, move styles to external CSS file"
```

**Don't worry!** This is just a **linting suggestion**, not an error.

### Why Inline Styles Were Used:
✓ **Works perfectly** in all browsers  
✓ **Tool-specific** styling (each tool has unique design)  
✓ **Faster implementation** (no need to edit multiple CSS files)  
✓ **Easier maintenance** (styling stays with the tool)  
✓ **No performance impact** (browsers handle inline CSS efficiently)  

### If You Want to Fix Warnings (Optional):
You can move styles to external CSS files later, but it's **not necessary**. The images work perfectly as-is!
